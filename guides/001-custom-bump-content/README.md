# Replace Default Bump Content with Custom Content

In this guide I will show you how to add Custom Content to the ClickFunnels Bump box on a cart page.
No need for paid addons or plugins, you can do this for FREE using Javascript and ClickFunnel's page editor.

The ClickFunnels Bump box provides very limited customization options. It only allows marketers to customize basic colors and enter a single line of text.

With this guide, customization of the ClickFunnels bump box is only limited by your imagination!
